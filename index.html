            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am a designer at heart with a passion for music. Currently studying Computer Science at Pikes Peak State College where
            I have a 4.0, and am a Phi Theta Kappa and NSLS student. I am attending Code Fellows Advanced Software Development in
            Java with Spring MVC and Android in fall 2022. My goal is to become a blockchain developer in the next couple of years.
            In my spare time I enjoy spending time outdoors, hot springs, hiking, working out, and making music on Ableton Live with my brother. I
            found myself in armed security after the COVID pandemic where I manage a small team of 15-20 employees contracted to
            secure cannabis facilities in Colorado. During my tenure, our company has grown from 1 contract to 8 and counting with
            healthy, steady growth. I'm dedicated to my personal growth after some time away from loving myself in my early 20s. I
            look forward to the future but stay mindful and grateful for the present.</p>
